## Component Descriptions

### `data/`
This directory stores all raw and processed data files used and generated by the project. It ensures a clear separation of data from source code.

### `src/`
The source code directory, containing all the Python modules and packages developed for the project.

#### `preprocessing/`
Module dedicated to the initial processing of data:
- `data_loader.py`: Contains functions responsible for loading data from different sources into the project.
- `data_preprocessor.py`: Includes functions for cleaning, filtering, and preparing the data for further analysis or network generation.

#### `token_projection/`
Module focused on the generation and analysis of token projection networks:
- `network_generator.py`: Functions for creating token projection networks from processed data.
- `network_analysis.py`: Analysis functions that operate on the token projection networks to extract insights and metrics.

#### `wallet_projection/`
Similar to the token projection module but focuses on wallet projection networks:
- `wallet_network_generator.py`: Functions for generating wallet projection networks.
- `wallet_network_analysis.py`: Contains analysis functions tailored to wallet projection networks.

#### `analysis/`
Contains classes and functions for performing in-depth analyses, such as:
- `clique_analysis.py`: Houses the `CliqueAnalysis` class and related functionalities for analyzing cliques within networks.

#### `visualisations/`
Dedicated to visualizing the outcomes of analyses:
- `visualisation.py`: Provides functions and utilities for generating various visualizations of the data and analysis results.

#### `utilities/`
A collection of utility functions that provide common functionality across the project:
- `statistical_tests.py`: Implements statistical tests and calculations used in various analyses, such as t-tests and Gini coefficient calculations.

### `notebooks/`
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for experimental analysis, demonstration of the project's capabilities, and exploratory data analysis.

### `main.py`
The main script of the project that orchestrates the entire data analysis process, from loading and preprocessing data to executing specific analyses and generating visualizations.
